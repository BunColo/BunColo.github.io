# Accessing and Using the DeepAneurysm Website
I should have a version of the DeepAneurysm website running at all times, which can be accessed by
going to the address: http://10.240.37.18:8501/
You need to be on the Rowan VPN to access this site. The site should run perpetually, as long as
the Lambda server is running.

# How to Use the Website
The website opens on a welcome page, which contains a short blurb about the project, and an
informational video. You can access the table of contents on the side, and select a model
to run, or "About the Project" to learn more. When a model has been selected, you can then
choose to upload your own CT scans, or use one of the samples provided.
